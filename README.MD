# FeroGrammer
FeroGrammer is a simple tool for generating electropherogram-like plots given a nucleotide sequence.

### Input parameters

- Base sequence: 
allowed characters are only valid nucleotides (actg/ACTG). Heterozygosity has to be input with an N followed by the two bases between brackets (e.g. ```N(AC)```) in the sequence.

- Sequence start position: an integer indicating the position of the first base of the input sequence

### Usage
Input the sequence and start position and press the ```generate it!``` button >> Enjoy your diagram
Window can be resized by simple dragging of the corners to achieve desired size of the diagram.
The export function will output a png file with the same size as the current window (resize window to desired size and then export for optimal results!)
